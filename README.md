letter guessing game

Psychic Game
This is a guessing game where the user tries to guess the same alphabet letter as the computer's random choice.  Using the keyboard, the user
can enter up to seven (7) letter guesses.  If the user guesses the letter, a point will be added to the win column, and the guesses will reset.
If the user tries seven letters with no success, a loss will be added. After 7 unsuccessful tries, the game will be reset.

To get started: Simply choose a alphabetic letter from the keyboard. Avoid special characters, tab/function keys and numbers.
